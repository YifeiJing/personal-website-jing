        <h3>Hermann Hesse</h3>
        <p>If I know what love is, it is because of you.</p>
        <p>Some of us think holding on makes us strong; but sometimes it is letting go.</p>
        <p>If you hate a person, you hate something in him that is part of yourself. What isn't part of ourselves doesn't disturb us.</p>
        <p>The truth is lived, not taught.</p>
        <p>Happiness is a how; not a what. A talent, not an object.</p>
        <p>Eternity is a mere moment, just long enough for a joke.</p>
        <p>One never reaches home, but wherever friendly paths intersect the whole world looks like home for a time.</p>
        <p>Love of God is not always the same as love of good.</p>
        <p>The world is not imperfect or slowly evolving along a path to perfection. No, it is perfect at every moment, every sin already carries grace in it.</p>
        <p>Our mind is capable of passing beyond the dividing line we have drawn for it. Beyond the pairs of opposites of which the world consists, other, new insights begin.</p>
